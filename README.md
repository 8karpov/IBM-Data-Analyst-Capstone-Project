# Introduction To Capstone Project

I have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants.  In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, your organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, I assisted with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

My first task was to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:

- Job postings
- Training portals
- Surveys

Once you I collected enough data, I began analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that included the following:

- What are the top programming languages in demand?
- What are the top database skills in demand?
- What are the popular IDEs?

I began by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.

Once this was completed, I made that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques.

When the data was ready I applied statistical techniques to analyze the data.  Then brought all of information together by using  IBM Cognos Analytics and created the dashboard, which is available at the link https://github.com/8karpov/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/DASHBOARD%20Peer-Graded%20Assignment_%20Part%20A%20-%20Building%20A%20Dashboard%20With%20IBM%20Cognos%20Analytics%20v2.pdf. And finally, showed off my storytelling skills by sharing my findings in a presentation, which is available at the link https://github.com/8karpov/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Technologies%20Trends.pdf.
